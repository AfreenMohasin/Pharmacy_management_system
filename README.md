SMART PHARMACY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This is a small pharmacy management application built using Flask.
It handles day-to-day tasks like billing, maintaining stock, tracking expenses,
and keeping a record of customers. It also includes a simple analytics section
that helps predict sales and identify medicines that may run out soon.

FEATURES:

Generate invoices with automatic tax, discount, and profit calculations

Real-time stock updates when items are sold

Add and manage pharmacy inventory

Track expenses and customer purchase history

Dashboard with revenue, profit, and 7-day sales overview

Predict upcoming sales and low-stock items based on past data

Export inventory, sales, and financial reports as CSV.



HOW THE PREDICTION WORKS??

Sales Forecasting:
Looks at the last 7 days’ revenue and estimates the next week’s sales.

Low-Stock Prediction:
Checks 30 days of usage for each medicine to see how many days of stock are left.

These are simple calculations — nothing heavy like machine learning — but they help with basic decision-making.
